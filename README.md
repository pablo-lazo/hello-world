# hello-world
Miscellaneous content

Light overhead
storm clouds part and the darkness fades and in the stillness of a
New dawn you're still standing
you know it's a frightening world and it's a confusing
World, but you know that I have to believe you will find the goodness in it
with your heart
And soul as compass I will pray you find your way and that happiness will follow close behind and peace will fall on you
